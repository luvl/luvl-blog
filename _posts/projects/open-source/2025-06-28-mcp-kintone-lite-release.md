description: "Introducing MCP Kintone Lite, a simple and lightweight Kintone MCP server for connecting AI assistants to Kintone applications and data"
---

I'm excited to announce the release of MCP Kintone Lite, a streamlined Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that bridges AI assistants with Kintone business process platform. This lightweight solution is perfect for automating workflows and integrating Kintone with AI tools.

## Technical Stack

### Core Framework
- **FastMCP**: High-level MCP implementation for rapid development
- **Python 3.10+**: Modern Python features and performance
- **Kintone SDK**: Direct API integration with Kintone platform

### AI Integration
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Anthropic's open standard for AI-data connections
- **Claude Desktop**: Primary target for seamless AI integration
- **Basic Authentication**: Secure Kintone username/password authentication

### Development Tools
- **UV**: Ultra-fast Python package manager and runner
- **Poetry**: Alternative dependency management
- **PyPI**: Published package for easy installation

## Key Features

### Kintone Operations
- Access all Kintone apps based on user permissions
- Execute queries with filtering and pagination
- Perform CRUD operations on Kintone records
- Retrieve app form fields and metadata

### Security & Performance
- Secure Basic Authentication (username/password)
- Built-in validation and error handling
- Comprehensive input validation
- Production-ready security measures

### Developer Experience
- One-command installation: `pip install mcp-kintone-lite`
- Multiple deployment options (UV, Poetry, direct Python)
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Easy Claude Desktop integration

      "args": ["--from", "mcp-kintone-lite", "mcp-kintone-lite"],
      "env": {
        "KINTONE_SUBDOMAIN": "your-subdomain",
        "KINTONE_USERNAME": "your-username",
        "KINTONE_PASSWORD": "your-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone and install for development
git clone https://github.com/luvl/mcp-kintone-lite.git
cd mcp-kintone-lite
uv sync  # or poetry install
```

## Available Tools

The server provides AI assistants with these capabilities:

### Query Operations
