ペーパードライバーからの挑戦 - 1日目の記録

## The Background Story

これまでの経緯

For a year and a half, my Japanese driving license has remained just a piece of plastic in my wallet. Like many "paper drivers" (ペーパードライバー) in Japan, I:
- Passed the test but never drove
- Held the license without practical experience
- Felt increasingly anxious about starting

時が過ぎていきました。

## Essential Preparations

運転開始の準備

Before starting practical driving, several key elements were necessary:

   - Approximately ¥3,000/day

   - Legally required for new drivers
   - Alerts other drivers
   - Provides extra consideration in traffic
   - Must be displayed front and back

   - Warning triangle
   - Basic tool kit
