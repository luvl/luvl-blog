住宅火災保険との出会い - 日本の保険システムの素晴らしさ

When I first bought my house in Hachioji, the concept of 住宅火災保険 (house fire insurance) seemed like just another expensive requirement. Coming from Vietnam, where insurance claims are often complicated and time-consuming, I was skeptical about paying ¥300,000-350,000 for a 5-year period.

## The Unexpected Event

2024年9月19日、八王子で予期せぬ出来事が起こりました。

I was at the office when a severe hailstorm hit Hachioji. Upon returning home, I found significant damage:
- Broken 雨樋 (rain gutters)
- Damaged garden plants and herbs
- Cracked 軒天 (eaves)

My first instinct, shaped by my Vietnamese background, was to handle everything myself. Since I was busy with work, I ignored completely:
- Fixing the broken pipes
- Salvaging what remained of my garden
- Planning repairs for the 軒天

## The Persistent Broker

数週間後、保険の話が始まりました。

For two months, I received numerous visits from insurance brokers who noticed the visible damage to my house. Being busy with work, I initially ignored them, especially since I had only changed working companies two months prior.

## The Turning Point

ある土曜日、同年代の日本人男性との出会いが全てを変えました。

What made this broker different was his genuine communication style. Despite my initial reluctance, his approach was:
- Friendly and patient
- Clear in explaining the process
- Understanding of my foreigner status

## The Process

予想以上にスムーズな手続き：
- Documentation: 1 week
- Approval waiting time: 2 weeks
- Result: Over ¥1.5 million in compensation

This experience completely changed my perspective on Japanese insurance. The broker not only helped with the claim but also shared valuable advice:
- Using part of the compensation for repairs
- Maintaining documentation for future claims
- Tips about 確定申告 for possible 10% tax reduction

## Reflection

この経験から学んだこと：
1. Japanese systems truly support residents, regardless of nationality
2. Insurance isn't just a requirement - it's genuine protection
3. Clear communication and patience can lead to unexpected benefits

今では彼は単なる保険ブローカーではなく、
住宅のことについて相談できる
心強い友人となりました。

This experience reminded me once again why I love living in Japan. The systematic support, honest service, and genuine care for residents - whether Japanese or foreign - continue to amaze me.

頑張ります！
