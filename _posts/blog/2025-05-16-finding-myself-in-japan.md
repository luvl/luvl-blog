関西への帰還 - 8年間の心の軌跡

Sitting here at Rinku Town near Kansai Airport, watching the sea stretch endlessly before me, I find myself reflecting on a journey that spans eight years of memories, heartbreak, growth, and healing.

## Eight Years Ago - The First Chapter

8年前の私へ

In 2017, I first came to Osaka as a different person - young, heartbroken, seeking refuge in work. For one month, I built a routine like armor:
- The same miso soup that warmed more than just my body
- The same streets that witnessed my silent struggles
- The same dedication to work that helped me forget, if only momentarily

毎日同じ道を歩き、
同じ味噌汁で心を温め、
仕事に没頭していた日々。

## Return to Yesterday

昨日への帰還

Before my friend joined me on this trip, I arrived a day early, drawn to the places of my past. Standing at Shin-Osaka Station, where Matsuya still stands opposite like a familiar friend, I realized that the young professional from eight years ago still lives within me:
- Still working too hard
- Still carrying the same gentle sadness
- Still learning to love myself

変わった街並みの中で、
変わらない心の痛みを
抱きしめている自分がいました。

## Osaka - Where the Journey Began Again

大阪での第一歩

My new adventure started in Osaka, just a peaceful 10-minute walk from Nakatsu Station. The city welcomed me with its characteristic warmth - so different from Tokyo's polished reserve. The day unfolded like a carefully written story:
- Osaka Castle standing proud against the sky, its history echoing through stone walls
- A memorable unagi lunch that reminded me how food can tell stories
- Evening views from Abeno Harukas that made the city look like scattered stars
- The vibrant energy of Dotonbori, leading to a soul-warming ramen dinner

## Kyoto - Where Time Slows Down

京都での気づき

Kyoto opened its arms with a traditional teishoku that set the tone for what was to come. Each destination felt like a page from an ancient poem:
- Kinkakuji's golden reflection, perfect in its stillness
- Arashiyama's bamboo forest whispering secrets in the breeze
- The vermillion gates of Fushimi Inari-taisha leading to somewhere sacred
- Yasaka Temple and Kiyomizu-dera offering perspectives both physical and spiritual
- Gion's streets holding centuries of stories in their stones

## Nara - Where Nature Meets Tradition

奈良での出会い

The deer of Nara bowed politely, as if understanding the weight in my heart. Kasuga Temple's lanterns seemed to light not just the paths but also the way forward in my thoughts.

## The Unexpected Journey Within

予期せぬ心の旅

Throughout this trip, I traveled with someone special - a best friend whose path was already set toward another destiny. Each night brought tears, each morning brought clarity. We navigated our feelings with grace:
- Clear boundaries set with kindness
- Friendship preserved through understanding
- Care expressed through small gestures

私たちは友情の意味を新しく学びました。

## The Space Between Then and Now

時の狭間で

Eight years of growth, yet some things remain constant:
- The comfort found in Japanese convenience stores
- The healing power of a simple miso soup
- The way Osaka's streets feel like they understand

But perhaps what hasn't changed is what needs to change the most - the habit of losing myself in work instead of finding myself in life.

## Lessons Learned

この旅で気づいたこと：

1. The importance of being "イッキ" (self-prioritizing) over self-sacrificing
2. Health should never be compromised for work
3. Different regions of Japan hold different spirits - Kansai's warmth contrasts beautifully with Tokyo's efficiency
4. Cultural preservation isn't just about buildings - it's about souls
5. Self-love isn't selfish - it's necessary

## A Promise to Myself

自分への約束

Somewhere between the memories of eight years ago and the present moment, I realize:
- The emptiness in my heart doesn't make me less worthy
- The coldness I feel doesn't make me less warm to others
- My weaknesses are part of who I am, not defects to be hidden

いつか必ず、
この全てを受け入れてくれる人と出会える。
その日まで、もう少し自分を大切にしていきたい。

## Looking Forward

これからの私へ：

Shopping at Takashimaya Osaka and experiencing teamLab were final reminders that joy can coexist with growth. The Japanese concept of preservation - of culture, relationships, and self - has taught me that taking care of oneself is as important as caring for others.

今の私は、
自分の健康を大切にし、
もっと日本を旅して、
自分らしく生きていきたいと思います。

As I watch the planes take off from Kansai Airport, I realize this journey wasn't just about visiting places - it was about finding pieces of myself in every temple visited, every meal shared, and every tear shed. Japan has once again proven to be not just a destination, but a teacher of life's most important lessons.

これからの私は、
仕事だけでなく、
自分自身との向き合い方も
少しずつ変えていきたいと思います。

頑張ります！
