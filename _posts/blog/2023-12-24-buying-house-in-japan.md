家を買うことは簡単ではありませんでしたが、夢が叶いました。

When I first arrived in Japan on June 1st, 2022, with my 業務 visa, owning a house seemed like a distant dream. Yet here I am, writing this post from my own garden in Hachioji. The journey wasn't straightforward, but it's a story worth sharing.

## The Initial Challenge

My situation was unique:
- Only 6 months of 確定申告 so income is below 300万円
- 5-year 業務 visa
- In japan for 1 year
- Dream of having a garden ;)

Despite these constraints, I managed to secure a 70% loan. The banker's reaction still makes me smile - it wasn't just about the numbers, but about my passion for Japan.

## The Market Research

私の家探しの旅:
- Explored from Chiba to Saitama
- Investigated Kanagawa
- Finally found Hachioji

Yes, it's 1.5 hours from my workplace. But the quiet neighborhood and the possibility of having my own garden made it worth every minute of the commute.

## The First Disappointment

最初の家は逃してしまいました。
Even though I registered first, someone with cash payment took it away. It was disappointing, but looking back, it led me to something better.

## The Success Story

When I found my current house, I didn't hesitate:
- Called the broker immediately after listing
- Made 3 trips from 葛飾区 to 八王子
- 2.5 hours each way
- Completed documentation in 3 weeks

## The Bank Interview

The interview was memorable. Instead of just financial questions, they asked about:
- My motivation for coming to Japan
- Passion for Japanese culture
- Future plans with AI
- Past experiences

The interviewer's ほめる words reminded me why I love Japan. Each question reinforced my decision to build a life here.

## The Final Twist

面白いことに、私の家の後ろに住んでいる方も買いたがっていたそうです。
It was a close call - the neighbor behind wanted to buy it too!

## Reflection

This journey taught me that sometimes, the harder path leads to better destinations. My 1.5-hour commute gives me time to appreciate the transition between busy Tokyo life and my peaceful garden.

これからも、日本での新しい冒険を楽しみにしています。
家族のためにも、
庭のためにも、
夢のためにも。

頑張ります！
